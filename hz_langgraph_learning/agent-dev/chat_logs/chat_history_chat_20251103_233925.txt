Based on what you've shared with me, I know that you're particularly interested in tech stocks, specifically META, TSLA, NVDA, and GOOG. You're monitoring TSLA for short-term trading movements and researching P/E ratios for META, GOOG, and TSLA. You have a watchlist that includes TSLA, META, NVDA, and GOOG for the tech sector, and you're following TSLA news and price movements closely. 

I don't have any memory of previous conversations with you, as this appears to be our first interaction. I'll keep these interests in mind as we move forward and can help you with real-time data, news, and analysis on these stocks whenever you'd like.

what's the max pain point for TSLA for at this Friday?

I don't have the specific max pain point for TSLA options for this Friday in the available data. The sources mention Tesla options data including max pain calculations, but don't provide the exact value for this Friday's expiration. Here are the key takeaways: TSLA was trading at $468.37, up 2.59% at market close on Nov 3. Options data is available through OPRA with 15-minute delays. Max pain theory suggests the stock price may gravitate toward a specific strike price where options would expire worthless. Tesla has shown significant volatility with a maximum gain of 91.65% according to the chart data

When can I expect to have the max pain point?

I don't have specific information about when max pain point calculations become available for TSLA options. Max pain theory suggests that options sellers will try to push the stock price to a point where the maximum number of options expire worthless, but the timing of when these calculations are published varies by financial data provider. Here are the key takeaways: Max pain is calculated based on open interest and strike prices of options. The timing of when max pain calculations become available varies by provider. Financial websites like Investopedia, Bloomberg, or TD Ameritrade typically provide max pain data. Max pain calculations are typically updated as options approach expiration. For TSLA options expiring this Friday, max pain data would likely become available mid-week
